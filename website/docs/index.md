# Sysdig Provider

The Sysdig provider is used to interact with
[Sysdig Secure](https://sysdig.com/product/secure/) and
[Sysdig Monitor](https://sysdig.com/product/monitor/) products. The provider
needs to be configure with the proper API token before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Configure the Sysdig provider
provider "sysdig" {
  sysdig_monitor_api_token = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  sysdig_secure_api_token = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}

// Create a new secure policy
resource "sysdig_secure_policy" "unexpected_inbound_tcp_connection_traefik" {
  # ...
}
```

## Example with extra headers

```terraform
provider "sysdig" {
  sysdig_monitor_api_token = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  sysdig_secure_api_token = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  extra_headers = {
    "Proxy-Authorization": "Basic xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```

## Configuration Reference

The following keys can be used to configure the provider.

* `sysdig_monitor_api_token` - (Optional) The Sysdig Monitor API token, it must be
  present, but you can get it from the `SYSDIG_MONITOR_API_TOKEN` environment variable.
  Required if any `sysdig_monitor_*` resource or data source is used. 

* `sysdig_secure_api_token` - (Optional) The Sysdig Secure API token, it must be
  present, but you can get it from the `SYSDIG_SECURE_API_TOKEN` environment variable.
  Required if any `sysdig_secure_*` resource or data source is used.

* `sysdig_monitor_url` - (Optional) This is the target Sysdig Monitor base API
  endpoint. It's intended to be used with OnPrem installations. By defaults it
  points to `https://app.sysdigcloud.com`, and notice that should not be ended
  with an slash. It can also be sourced from the `SYSDIG_MONITOR_URL` environment
  variable.
  
* `sysdig_secure_url` - (Optional) This is the target Sysdig Secure base API
  endpoint. It's intended to be used with OnPrem installations. By defaults it
  points to `https://secure.sysdig.com`, and notice that should not be ended
  with an slash. It can also be sourced from the `SYSDIG_SECURE_URL` environment
  variable.
  
* `sysdig_monitor_insecure_tls` - (Optional) Defines if the HTTP client can ignore
  the use of invalid HTTPS certificates in the Monitor API. It can be useful for 
  on-prem installations. It can also be sourced from the `SYSDIG_MONITOR_INSECURE_TLS`
  environment variable. By default this is false.

* `sysdig_secure_insecure_tls` - (Optional) Defines if the HTTP client can ignore
  the use of invalid HTTPS certificates in the Secure API. It can be useful for 
  on-prem installations. It can also be sourced from the `SYSDIG_SECURE_INSECURE_TLS`
  environment variable. By default this is false.

* `extra_headers` - (Optional) Defines extra HTTP headers that will be added to the client
  while performing HTTP API calls.
