Creates a Sysdig Monitor Event Alert. Monitor occurrences of specific events, and alert if the total 
number of occurrences violates a threshold. Useful for alerting on container, orchestration, and 
service events like restarts and deployments.

	description = "A Kubernetes pod failed to pull an image from the registry"
	severity = 4

	event_name = "Failed to pull image"
	source = "kubernetes"
	event_rel = ">"
	event_count = 0

	multiple_alerts_by = ["kubernetes.pod.name"]
	
	trigger_after_minutes = 1
}
```
