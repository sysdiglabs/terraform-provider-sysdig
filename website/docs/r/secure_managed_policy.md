# Resource: sysdig_secure_managed_policy

Manages configuration of a Sysdig Secure Managed Policy.

-> **Note:** Sysdig managed policies are not resources that you create. They are provided by Sysdig. This resource
allows you to identify and configure a managed policy. The managed policy is looked up by its name and type.

-> **Note:** Sysdig Terraform Provider is under rapid development at this point. If you experience any issue or discrepancy while using it, please make sure you have the latest version. If the issue persists, or you have a Feature Request to support an additional set of resources, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-provider-sysdig/issues/new) in the GitHub repository.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "sysdig_secure_notification_channel" "email_notification_channel" {
  name = "Test Email Channel"
}

resource "sysdig_secure_managed_policy" "sysdig_runtime_threat_detection" {
  name = "Sysdig Runtime Threat Detection"
  type = "falco"
  enabled = true
  runbook = "https://runbook.com"
  
  // Scope selection
  scope = "container.id != \"\""

  // Disabling rules
  disabled_rules = ["Suspicious Cron Modification"]

  actions {
    container = "stop"
    capture {
      seconds_before_event = 5
      seconds_after_event = 10
    }
  }

  notification_channels = [data.sysdig_secure_notification_channel.email_notification_channel.id]
}
```
