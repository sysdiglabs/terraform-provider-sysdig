~> **Note:** Sysdig Terraform Provider is under rapid development at this point. If you experience any issue or discrepancy while using it, please make sure you have the latest version. If the issue persists, or you have a Feature Request to support an additional set of resources, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-provider-sysdig/issues/new) in the GitHub repository.  

## Example usage

```hcl
resource "sysdig_secure_vulnerability_exception_list" "sample" {
  name        = "TERRAFORM TEST 1 %s"
  description = "TERRAFORM TEST %s"
}

resource "time_static" "example" {
  rfc3339 = "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}

resource "sysdig_secure_vulnerability_exception" "sample" {
  cve             = "CVE-1234-1234"
  list_id         = sysdig_secure_vulnerability_exception_list.sample.id
  expiration_date = time_static.example.unix
  notes           = "Example notes on why this exception is created"
  enabled         = false
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `cve` - (Required) The CVE ID to make an exception to.

* `list_id` - (Required) The ID of the Vulnerability exception list to assign this exception to.

* `expiration_date` - (Optional) The expiration date of the exception, useful if you want to ignore
                      some vulnerability only for a period of time. The time specified is Unix timestamp,
                      and must reference a date at 00:00:00 AM. See the example where the referenced date
                      is the 1st of January 2025. Default: 0 (no expiration date).

* `notes` - (Optional) Some context of why this vulnerability is being ignored.

* `enabled` - (Optional) If this is false, the CVE exception will be ignored, use this if you don't want to delete
              the exception. Default: true.
