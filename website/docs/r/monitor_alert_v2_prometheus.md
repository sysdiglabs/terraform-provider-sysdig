## Example Usage

```terraform

  name = "Elasticsearch JVM heap usage"
  description = "Elasticsearch JVM heap used over attention threshold"
  severity = "high"
  query = "(elasticsearch_jvm_memory_used_bytes{area=\"heap\"} / elasticsearch_jvm_memory_max_bytes{area=\"heap\"}) * 100 > 80"
  trigger_after_minutes = 10
  notification_channels {
    id = 1234
    renotify_every_minutes = 5
  }
}
```
