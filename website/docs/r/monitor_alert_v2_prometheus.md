# Resource: sysdig_monitor_alert_v2_prometheus

Monitor your infrastructure with PromQL queries, maintaining full compatibility with OSS Prometheus.

-> **Note:** Sysdig Terraform Provider is under rapid development at this point. If you experience any issue or discrepancy while using it, please make sure you have the latest version. If the issue persists, or you have a Feature Request to support an additional set of resources, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-provider-sysdig/issues/new) in the GitHub repository.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sysdig_monitor_alert_v2_prometheus" "sample" {
  name = "Elasticsearch JVM heap usage"
  description = "Elasticsearch JVM heap used over attention threshold"
  severity = "high"
  query = "(elasticsearch_jvm_memory_used_bytes{area=\"heap\"} / elasticsearch_jvm_memory_max_bytes{area=\"heap\"}) * 100 > 80"
  duration_seconds = 600
  notification_channels {
    id = 1234
    renotify_every_minutes = 5
  }
  labels = {
    application = "app1"
    maturity = "high"
  }
}
```

* `href` - (Optional) When using `runbook` type, url of the external resource.
* `id` - (Optional) When using `dashboard` type, dashboard id.

### Prometheus alert arguments

* `query` - (Required) PromQL-based metric expression to alert on. Example: `histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(etcd_http_successful_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]) > 0.15` or `predict_linear(sysdig_fs_free_bytes{fstype!~"tmpfs"}[1h], 24*3600) < 10000000000`.
* `keep_firing_for_minutes` - (Optional) Alert resolution delay before actually resolving an alert.
