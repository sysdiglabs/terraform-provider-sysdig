# Resource: sysdig_monitor_alert_promql

Creates a Sysdig Monitor PromQL Alert. Monitor prometheus metrics and alert if they violate user-defined PromQL-based metric expression.

`~> **Note:** Sysdig Terraform Provider is under rapid development at this point. If you experience any issue or discrepancy while using it, please make sure you have the latest version. If the issue persists, or you have a Feature Request to support an additional set of resources, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/sysdiglabs/terraform-provider-sysdig/issues/new) in the GitHub repository.`

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sysdig_monitor_alert_promql" "sample" {
	name = "Elasticsearch JVM heap usage"
	description = "A Kubernetes pod failed to restart"
	severity = 6

	promql = "(elasticsearch_jvm_memory_used_bytes{area=\"heap\"} / elasticsearch_jvm_memory_max_bytes{area=\"heap\"}) * 100 > 80"
	trigger_after_minutes = 10
}
```

* `prepend` - (Optional) Text to add before the alert template.
* `append` - (Optional) Text to add after the alert template.

### PromQL alert arguments

* `promql` - (Required) PromQL-based metric expression to alert on. Example: `histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(etcd_http_successful_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]) > 0.15` or `predict_linear(sysdig_fs_free_bytes{fstype!~"tmpfs"}[1h], 24*3600) < 10000000000`.
